## What is the role of technology in the health field?
Health and technology have always been involving since the beginning of the human race. Early on, paper, the wheel, and even glue were created and we still use today.
The medical field is the same way. The first civilizations used medicnial plants in order to relieve pain, and now those plants are the basis for a ton of different medicines. 
As the years went on technology and the medical field influenced each other. When paper was created, case studies and diseases were documents and we can still see some of those documents today.
Now technology and medicine are progressing more rapidly now than ever. With the creation of the computer and the internet the medical field exploded. 
Now it is easy to share research and ideas and collaborate with others all over the world. Currently there's been some interesting intersections between biology and technology.
### Bread and Cancer???
Back in 2017 a Japanese bakery would bake a million different pastries and to someone who is not a pastry expert I have no clue what anything is. So during checkout you would place whatever pastry into 
a rectangluar box and you would look at a screen and there would be a bunch of different little green lines and it would tell you want you got and the price. 
This greatly helped the cashiers and allowed the bakery to produce a wider variety of pastries. Well you know what a bunch of pastries apparently looks like?
Cancer cells... A partnership between a bakery and medical research began. Now this same program is being used for a wide variety of issues in the medical field 
and is still in use at that bakery. 
### There's a computer made of human brain cells? 
More recently, back in June, a biocomputer was created. A swiss startup called FinalSpark created a biocomputer with 16 mini-brains. So the human brain is actually 
super efficient. We have over 86 billion neurons and it's amazing what they are capable of. For this to be used as a computer is an interesting idea. 
This consumes a million times less power than a traditional computer. This could greatly reduce the environmental impact of classical computers. They are
currently training this computer to handle large language models and it will be interesting to see how it performs.
